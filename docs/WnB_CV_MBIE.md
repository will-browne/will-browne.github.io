Prof. Browne has researched industrial and process optimisation for two decades using mechatronic and advanced optimisation techniques from the field of artificial intelligence. Collaboration with Alcoa, UK led to **£500,000 annual saving** through data mining and knowledge extraction in their rolled aluminium processes.

The design of stroke rehabilitation robotics with optimal control, including advanced perception through sensing, has an on-going relationship with Im- Able Ltd, which led to initial papers, but now the work is embargoed whilst intellectual property rights are being protected for the advanced designs.

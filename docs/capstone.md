## List of Project Abstracts

### EER-AR-Robotics
Project Description:
As automation and robotics grow to be more prevalent in our lives, human-robot interactions (HRI) are becoming more commonplace. Recent advancements in augmented reality (AR) and extended reality (XR) technologies offer greater opportunities for more immersive robotics experiences.

In this project, you will explore the use of AR/XR in human-robot interactions. Coupling AR/XR with robotics offers potential for greater interaction and information-rich feedback for operators. Feedback includes the current joint state, the robot’s next state and the planned path to that state. AR/XR can be leveraged to simulate robots allowing for interactive simulation and training, reducing the risks around using industrial robots and pre-empting costly collisions with the worksite.

This project offers the opportunity to work alongside a trans-disciplinary team of specialist researchers in robotics, AR/XR, gaming and design. We seek candidates with an interest in human-machine interaction (HMI), human-robot interaction (HRI), robotics and automation, user experience (UX) and design.

Outcomes from this project centre around developing AR/XR demonstrations visualising live feedback of the current robotic state with a stretch goal of adding interactive features to the AR interface. This can be thought of as an augmented reality version of a visualisation system for a robot (e.g. RViz). It can also be thought of as a base Digital Twin to enable interactive data flow to and from the real-world systems.

### EER-Concierge
Visitors to S11 are met by a locked door rather than a friendly robot, which does not create the right first impression for QCR (QUT Centre for Robotics). QCR has a Temi "the personal robot" that is available to become the concierge for S11 floor where QCR is based.

Temi (robotemi.com) is an autonomous robot that is very good at going from A to B once programmed. However, they could do so much more! This project is to explore how the platform can be used to guide human (or otherwise) visitors in S11. It has a number of research themes where one or more will form the basis of this project:
Ethics of human robot interaction in terms of capturing images, storing data, recognising people and so forth. For example, if someone has opted out of their image being captured by the robot the first time they visit, how should the robot recognise them the second time?
Cobotics, i.e. collaborative robotics, in terms of how do people want to be guided and interact with the robot? When should the robot display a diagram of the route or simply ask the person to follow?
Behaviour based robotics, in terms of how should the robot behave in certain situations. If surrounded by a group of visitors, should the robot stay still or ask the visitors to move so it can be recharged? Can it anticipate what a visitor will do so will move aside to let the robot pass - curiously most people move aside for the robot currently rather than vice versa.
Emotion detection for behaviour modification of the robot, e.g. can the robot detect if a person is happy or angry to see the robot and adjust its responses accordingly?


### EER-Hallowed-Footwear

3D Digital Twin App Development for Footwear Measurement

Hallowed Footwear (hallowedfootwear.com.au)

Project Description: Hallowed Footwear are an SME that procures footwear for people with larger feet than standard stock sizes in High Street chains to sell on their e-commerce site. Measurement and sizing of feet is a time-consuming process, which is subject to uncertainty and error. This project is to investigate the use of smart phone cameras to capture augmented reality images of people’s feet to correctly size shoes. It should be noted that a nominal shoe size, e.g. EU 42, may differ in size depending on different shoe designers. Thus, this project has two stages. Firstly, to use a smart phone to measure a customer’s feet dimensions accurately and quickly to store in a digital twin. Secondly, to measure a range of shoes to determine the actual size and hence ascertain which products fit best to a given digital


### EER-Orrcon
Project Description: Orrcon Steel fabricate a wide range of stock product, such as tube and pipe, which needs to be distributed to customers and service centres. There is an opportunity to employ autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) and warehouse robotics to create improved operational practices. This includes optimising storage, warehousing, location, palletising, distribution and so forth. This project is twofold: first, create a base simulator that captures the important operational characteristics of the plant (both current and possible extensions to future configurations), second, determine optimisation methods (from dynamic programming to evolutionary computation) that can optimise the operation of simulated warehouse to provide guidelines to Orrcon Steel on future warehouse and AGV development.

### EER-RoboticWelding
Project Description: Robotic welding offers companies the ability to autonomously fulfil dull and dangerous welding and additive manufacturing tasks. This frees up employees’ time, upskills existing employees and addresses the skills/labour shortage experienced in Queensland manufacturing due to border closures. Many companies bought robotic welders but do not have the expertise to deploy them. Similarly, other companies would like to deploy robotic welders but are uncertain where to begin. This project is to create a robotic welding start-up guide for small to medium enterprises for that they can select, commission and deploy robotic welding for a range of common tasks. Initial research will be conducted on company needs, existing solutions and barriers to implementation. Using ARM Hub facilities, experiencing augmented reality welding training, and autonomous robotic welding will be gained. Design and development of a robotic welding ‘cell’ will act as a demonstrator to companies on how to maximise the use of a robotic welding.

### EER-Crane
Cranes have been an essential building block in our technological age that have been used to build structures and transport materials around the world. In the marine industry cranes play a large role for large container ships that require cranes to load and unload billions of dollars’ worth of minerals, materials and market goods every year. However, cranes are also used in the marine industry for smaller scale operations such as loading and unloading auxiliary vessels. With the current technological trends these types of small-scale crane operations are becoming more affordable with companies introducing more technology and automation than ever before. This project proposal will analyse the implementation of such technologies towards a real-world problem presented by an industry partner. In particular the project will focus on the challenges faced in these small-scale operations and what engineering literature is available to better understand the problem but also the potential solution. After close contact with the industry partner a set of essential and non-essential requirements will be discussed that will govern the projects milestones and deliverables. A communications plan is then outlined that is used to structure the Industry partner’s and QUT Supervisor’s relations that are used as information and feedback channels. Overall, the proposed project aims to be an affordable and professional solution for the industry partner that will be able to complete the first phase of systems integration towards a fully automated solution into the future.

### EER-AbstractRC
Project Description: DeepMind has hypothesised that one of the barriers to Artificial General Intelligence is the lack of the ability to abstract concepts in AI systems. For example, a robot could learn to move a 'red block behind a blue sphere' but would struggle to then "move a blue block in front of a red sphere" as its AI has no abstract concepts of ‘behind’/’in front’ or that objects have properties independent of their colour. Recently, the Abstraction Reasoning Corpus has been introduced by Chollet (cf their work on Kaggle and Keras) to provide a benchmark to accelerate such learning (cf ImageNet for computer vision). This project will build on the notion of sensor-action movement to build up abstractions from the environment (cf Cognits by J. Fuster). The first task is to create a physical abstraction reasoning corpus that a manipulator robots can explore to learn about abstract concepts. Reinforcement learning will be used to learn about relationships and properties of the environment and how these change as objects are manipulated, such that higher order patterns can be identified.

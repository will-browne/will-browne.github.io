## List of Project Abstracts
### EER-Crane
Cranes have been an essential building block in our technological age that have been used to build structures and transport materials around the world. In the marine industry cranes play a large role for large container ships that require cranes to load and unload billions of dollars’ worth of minerals, materials and market goods every year. However, cranes are also used in the marine industry for smaller scale operations such as loading and unloading auxiliary vessels. With the current technological trends these types of small-scale crane operations are becoming more affordable with companies introducing more technology and automation than ever before. This project proposal will analyse the implementation of such technologies towards a real-world problem presented by an industry partner. In particular the project will focus on the challenges faced in these small-scale operations and what engineering literature is available to better understand the problem but also the potential solution. After close contact with the industry partner a set of essential and non-essential requirements will be discussed that will govern the projects milestones and deliverables. A communications plan is then outlined that is used to structure the Industry partner’s and QUT Supervisor’s relations that are used as information and feedback channels. Overall, the proposed project aims to be an affordable and professional solution for the industry partner that will be able to complete the first phase of systems integration towards a fully automated solution into the future.

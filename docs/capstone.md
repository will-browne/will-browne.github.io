## List of Project Abstracts

### ERR-Robots-with-Spines
There are two complementary aspects to robotics in conjunction with spines, namely 1. robots that have spines can navigate more flexibly than rigid robots, and 2. spinal surgery robots need flexible navigation to operate without causing collateral damage. Depending on research interests number of related projects can be run under this topic area:
a) Develop designs for a quadruped robot with a spine. Quadruped, e.g. doglike, robots such as Spot, ANYmal, and low-cost versions are now commonly used for industrial activities such as human guidance and plant inspection. But the lack of flexible spine reduces their ease of navigation and reduces intuitive human interaction, e.g. poor physical feedback communication when acting as a guide dog. This initial project will look at simulation designs (i.e. URDFs) of a robotic dog with a spine in order to communicate internal states, observations and future intent.
b) The design of snake-like robots and end effectors have been created to navigate awkward environments, such as the internal human body. This project specifically considers the design of such robots so spinal surgery, where precision of navigation to a set configuration/pose is of high importance.
c) Path trajectory planning for spinal surgery robots. Both human guided and autonomous navigation of robots and end effectors for spinal surgery is an open area for research.

### EER-Gymbal
This is an industrial project with a start-up company, Stratoship, based at ARMHub - the tradeoff from having the industrial experience is that the company must own the project's outcomes as it will be important to their business. Hence, agreement will be needed upfront that IP created in this project is to be assigned to Stratoship.

This project is to develop a stabilised camera (or mirror) gimbal for use in the stratosphere, where the ambient temperature can reach -80°C. In this environment, most mechanisms fail due to differential thermal contraction between parts, freezing of lubricants and moisture, and failures of materials and adhesives. The gimbal is required to self-stabilise to compensate for movement of the stratospheric airship and be remotely controllable in a pan-tilt-zoom camera system. We’re open to designs that move the whole camera, and designs that feature a fixed camera with moving mirror/s.
We foresee this project happening in stages as described below. We consider the first two stages to be the core, and the third stage to be additional work.
a. Develop a concept design for a stabilised pan/tilt gimbal and control system, including a thermal concept and material selection that takes into account the extreme temperature range. This gimbal system should aim for simplicity, manufacturability, reliability, and minimum moving parts.
b. Develop the detailed mechanical, electronic/control and thermal design for one axis only. Build a working prototype, and demonstrate its functionality in a bench test, both at ambient temperatures and at extreme cold temperatures.
c. Develop the detailed mechanical, electronic/control and thermal design for the second axis. Prototype and bench test as described above.
Please be aware that the prototype gimbal will not necessarily be tested at stratospheric altitude during this project due to operational constraints and timing.

Successful students may be invited to future flights of the high altitude airship, where their projects will be tested in their intended environment.

### EER-Robot-Spraying
Robotic spraying cellulose to make building materials

Project Description:
Background:
Cellulose is a commonly used insulation material; through an innovative process, Zeoform is able to create building materials such as cladding and structural hollow sections using cellulose. The cellulose is sprayed onto a mould using a manual, labour-intensive process currently. Robotic technology has the potential to automate the process, increasing efficiency and safety. The main challenge in this process is achieving precision and repeatability in the application of cellulose insulation on the moulds.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a path-planning algorithm for a robot to spray cellulose insulation onto moulds to create structural hollow sections with precision and repeatability. The robot should be able to navigate the mould surface and apply the cellulose insulation in an efficient and repeatable manner.

Methods:
Research on existing path-planning algorithms and techniques
Develop a path-planning algorithm for the robot to navigate the mould surface
Test the algorithm on a simulation of a mould
Implement the algorithm on a physical robot and test it on real moulds

Expected Outcomes:
A path-planning algorithm that can navigate a mould surface and apply cellulose insulation in an efficient, precise and repeatable manner
A simulation of the robot's path on a mould surface
A demonstration of the algorithm's implementation on a physical robot

### EER-AR-Robotics
Project Description:
As automation and robotics grow to be more prevalent in our lives, human-robot interactions (HRI) are becoming more commonplace. Recent advancements in augmented reality (AR) and extended reality (XR) technologies offer greater opportunities for more immersive robotics experiences.

In this project, you will explore the use of AR/XR in human-robot interactions. Coupling AR/XR with robotics offers potential for greater interaction and information-rich feedback for operators. Feedback includes the current joint state, the robot’s next state and the planned path to that state. AR/XR can be leveraged to simulate robots allowing for interactive simulation and training, reducing the risks around using industrial robots and pre-empting costly collisions with the worksite.

This project offers the opportunity to work alongside a trans-disciplinary team of specialist researchers in robotics, AR/XR, gaming and design. We seek candidates with an interest in human-machine interaction (HMI), human-robot interaction (HRI), robotics and automation, user experience (UX) and design.

Outcomes from this project centre around developing AR/XR demonstrations visualising live feedback of the current robotic state with a stretch goal of adding interactive features to the AR interface. This can be thought of as an augmented reality version of a visualisation system for a robot (e.g. RViz). It can also be thought of as a base Digital Twin to enable interactive data flow to and from the real-world systems.

### EER-Concierge
Visitors to S11 are met by a locked door rather than a friendly robot, which does not create the right first impression for QCR (QUT Centre for Robotics). QCR has a Temi "the personal robot" that is available to become the concierge for S11 floor where QCR is based.

Temi (robotemi.com) is an autonomous robot that is very good at going from A to B once programmed. However, they could do so much more! This project is to explore how the platform can be used to guide human (or otherwise) visitors in S11. It has a number of research themes where one or more will form the basis of this project:
Ethics of human robot interaction in terms of capturing images, storing data, recognising people and so forth. For example, if someone has opted out of their image being captured by the robot the first time they visit, how should the robot recognise them the second time?
Cobotics, i.e. collaborative robotics, in terms of how do people want to be guided and interact with the robot? When should the robot display a diagram of the route or simply ask the person to follow?
Behaviour based robotics, in terms of how should the robot behave in certain situations. If surrounded by a group of visitors, should the robot stay still or ask the visitors to move so it can be recharged? Can it anticipate what a visitor will do so will move aside to let the robot pass - curiously most people move aside for the robot currently rather than vice versa.
Emotion detection for behaviour modification of the robot, e.g. can the robot detect if a person is happy or angry to see the robot and adjust its responses accordingly?

### EER-Stroke-Orthotic
This project is to develop a novel stroke rehabilitation orthotic, which has undergone several prototypes. The orthotic is a mechatronic device that attaches to a person suffering from the effects of stroke's upper/lower arm in order to actively stimulate the muscles in the hand/fingers. This provides improved neural plasticity in the learning of sensorimotor activation. This will be in conjunction with researchers interested in Medical Technologies. Novel sensing and actuation will need to be considered, e.g. integration of IMU and stretch sensors to monitor recovery rate. State-of-the-art additive manufacturing of the device is envisaged. The student will need a complete range of mechatronic skills from programming to basic control systems engineering. CAD familiarity is a must have skill.
Depending on a student's interest this project could range from writing an interface app for analysis to electronic circuit board design haptic interfacing with real and virtual objects.

### EER-Hallowed-Footwear
admin@hallowedfootwear.com.au
3D Digital Twin App Development for Footwear Measurement

Hallowed Footwear (hallowedfootwear.com.au)

Project Description: Hallowed Footwear are an SME that procures footwear for people with larger feet than standard stock sizes in High Street chains to sell on their e-commerce site. Measurement and sizing of feet is a time-consuming process, which is subject to uncertainty and error. This project is to investigate the use of smart phone cameras to capture augmented reality images of people’s feet to correctly size shoes. It should be noted that a nominal shoe size, e.g. EU 42, may differ in size depending on different shoe designers. Thus, this project has two stages. Firstly, to use a smart phone to measure a customer’s feet dimensions accurately and quickly to store in a digital twin. Secondly, to measure a range of shoes to determine the actual size and hence ascertain which products fit best to a given digital


### EER-Orrcon
Project Description: Orrcon Steel fabricate a wide range of stock product, such as tube and pipe, which needs to be distributed to customers and service centres. There is an opportunity to employ autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) and warehouse robotics to create improved operational practices. This includes optimising storage, warehousing, location, palletising, distribution and so forth. This project is twofold: first, create a base simulator that captures the important operational characteristics of the plant (both current and possible extensions to future configurations), second, determine optimisation methods (from dynamic programming to evolutionary computation) that can optimise the operation of simulated warehouse to provide guidelines to Orrcon Steel on future warehouse and AGV development.

### EER-RoboticWelding
Project Description: Robotic welding offers companies the ability to autonomously fulfil dull and dangerous welding and additive manufacturing tasks. This frees up employees’ time, upskills existing employees and addresses the skills/labour shortage experienced in Queensland manufacturing due to border closures. Many companies bought robotic welders but do not have the expertise to deploy them. Similarly, other companies would like to deploy robotic welders but are uncertain where to begin. This project is to create a robotic welding start-up guide for small to medium enterprises for that they can select, commission and deploy robotic welding for a range of common tasks. Initial research will be conducted on company needs, existing solutions and barriers to implementation. Using ARM Hub facilities, experiencing augmented reality welding training, and autonomous robotic welding will be gained. Design and development of a robotic welding ‘cell’ will act as a demonstrator to companies on how to maximise the use of a robotic welding.

### EER-Crane
Cranes have been an essential building block in our technological age that have been used to build structures and transport materials around the world. In the marine industry cranes play a large role for large container ships that require cranes to load and unload billions of dollars’ worth of minerals, materials and market goods every year. However, cranes are also used in the marine industry for smaller scale operations such as loading and unloading auxiliary vessels. With the current technological trends these types of small-scale crane operations are becoming more affordable with companies introducing more technology and automation than ever before. This project proposal will analyse the implementation of such technologies towards a real-world problem presented by an industry partner. In particular the project will focus on the challenges faced in these small-scale operations and what engineering literature is available to better understand the problem but also the potential solution. After close contact with the industry partner a set of essential and non-essential requirements will be discussed that will govern the projects milestones and deliverables. A communications plan is then outlined that is used to structure the Industry partner’s and QUT Supervisor’s relations that are used as information and feedback channels. Overall, the proposed project aims to be an affordable and professional solution for the industry partner that will be able to complete the first phase of systems integration towards a fully automated solution into the future.

### EER-AbstractRC
Project Description: DeepMind has hypothesised that one of the barriers to Artificial General Intelligence is the lack of the ability to abstract concepts in AI systems. For example, a robot could learn to move a 'red block behind a blue sphere' but would struggle to then "move a blue block in front of a red sphere" as its AI has no abstract concepts of ‘behind’/’in front’ or that objects have properties independent of their colour. Recently, the Abstraction Reasoning Corpus has been introduced by Chollet (cf their work on Kaggle and Keras) to provide a benchmark to accelerate such learning (cf ImageNet for computer vision). This project will build on the notion of sensor-action movement to build up abstractions from the environment (cf Cognits by J. Fuster). The first task is to create a physical abstraction reasoning corpus that a manipulator robots can explore to learn about abstract concepts. Reinforcement learning will be used to learn about relationships and properties of the environment and how these change as objects are manipulated, such that higher order patterns can be identified.
